# about me
i am a 23 year old economics/data science student and artist with interest across pretty much all quantitative, qualitative, and creative fields. this website is both portfolio and blog for my thoughts and analysis.

i am deeply interested in pursuing/participating in projects across all quantitative/qualitative fields. my dream is to work in sports analysis and sabermetrics, and any opportunities in these areas would be greatly appreciated. 

with any/all inquiries, contact ARKNDJL@GMAIL.COM or @ARKNDJL on twitter.
